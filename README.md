# moving_assets
Some things moving around a network on Cesium.js over time

Download cesium and install the node stuff it wants:
https://cesiumjs.org/downloads/



Navigate to the Apps directory in Cesium.

Clone this folder to

....../Cesium/Apps/asset_movements


then go back to ......../Cesium and run
'node server.js'

Navigate to http://localhost:8080/Apps/asset_movements/asset_moving.html

Note:
This might be all completable on android using Termux for a self contained VR experience.
If you have a Iphone, then you deserve to suffer from your bad choices, unless you can launch web servers from that too?

#TODO
Obviously this readme needs simplifying and massivly improving, and likely spell checking.

Thanks to Cesium, and the model asset creators of the dragon and spaceship, which have some licency shizle in the relevant folders...
Sadly the spaceship seems too complex for a mobile browser, so just using a spaceship for now
