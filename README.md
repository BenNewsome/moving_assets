# moving_assets
Some things moving around a network on Cesium.js over time

Download cesium and install the node stuff it wants

Navigate to the Apps directory in Cesium.

Clone this folder to

....../Cesium/Apps/asset_movements


then go back to ......../Cesium and run
'node server.js'

Navigate to http://localhost:8080/Apps/asset_movements/asset_moving.html

Note:
This might be all completable on android using TMUX for a self contained VR experience.
If you have a Iphone, then you deserve to suffer from your bad choices, unless you can launch web servers from that too?

#TODO
Obviously this readme needs simplifying and massivly improving, and likely spell checking.
